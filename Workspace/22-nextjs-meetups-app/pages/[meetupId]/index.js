  'getStaticPaths' is a function you need to export in a 'page' component file,
  if it's a dynamic page like we have it here AND you're using 'getStaticProps'.

  With 'getStaticProps', a page is pre-generated during the build process.
  This means that of course, NextJS needs to pre-generate all versions of this dynamic page in advance
  for all the supported IDs. 
  Because since this is dynamic, NextJS needs to know for which ID values it should pre-generate the page.

  'getStaticPaths' has the job of returning an object where we describe all the dynamic segment values.
  So all the meetup IDs in this case.

  'getStaticPaths' therefore is another important function, which you need in dynamic pages to tell NextJS
  for which dynamic parameter values this page should be pre-generated. 
  And then again, 'getStaticProps' executes for every page.
*/
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  /* 
    Here we could call fetch api to call our API routes
    e.g. fetch('/api/meetups');

    However this code in the 'getStaticProps' runs during "build time" and not exposed to client,
    we can directly get data using some helper function here.
    This will avoid sending unnecessary request to our own endpoint

    IMPORTANT -
    When you import something in a 'page' component file and that something is 
    then only used in getServerSideProps or getStaticProps, 
    then the imported package will NOT be part of the client side bundle. 
    So your credentials will NOT be exposed client/browser.

    So you can import both server side and clients side code here, and depending on where you use it,
    it will be included in different bundles which are independent from each other.
    That's a nice, smart feature built into nextJS.
